# MD-Components
A set of Material Design components and a 12-column grid. I wrote this framework in early 2017, in early 2018 I decided to refactor it.

## Components

* Buttons (in process)
  * Flat
  * Flat-Icon (in process)
  * Raised (in process 50%)
  * Floating (in process 50%)
  * Checkbox (in process 0%)

* Input Box (in process 75%)
* Card (in process 75%)
