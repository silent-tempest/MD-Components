# MD-Components
A set of Material Design components and a 12-column grid. I wrote this framework in early 2017, in early 2018 I decided to refactor it.

## Components

  * Floating (in process 50%)
  * Checkbox (in process 0%)
  * Radio (in process 0%)
* Input Box (in process 75%)
* Card (in process 75%)

Grid has five breakpoints:
1. XS - Extra Small (less than 361px)
2. SM - Small (361px-660px)
3. MD - Medium (661px-960px)
4. LG - Large (961px-1280px)
